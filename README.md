WatchItOnce
===========

VLC-based player which remembers last file position and deletes files after watch.

Available console keys:
 --sort-by-name	Sort files by name
 --random Sorts files randomly
 --random-continue Sorts files randomly but preffers to continue already staterd files (watched at least 4 seconds)
 --delete Delete file after playing an item
 --filter str Filter items by searching specified substring in the item name
 --tomato Plays only 25 minutes and closes the player

In the windows thumbnail mode the deletion of file/moving to the next file could be done by pressing the eject button (red icon) twice.
